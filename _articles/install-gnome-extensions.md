GNOME Extensions add more features to the default Pop!_OS / Ubuntu GNOME Shell.

### Browser extension

All Extensions will installed though the [GNOME Extension website](https://extensions.gnome.org/). You need a browser extension for the Browser to interact with GNOME Shell, we'll walk you though installing that below.

For Firefox in this example we need to allow the Extension website to ask to install the browser extension.

Now we can add the GNOME Shell integration.

### Install GNOME Shell extension

Once we find the extension that we want (in this case Dask to Dock) we have a black switch, click the switch and a prompt will come up to install it.

### Switch on GNOME Shell extension

The GNOME Tweak Tool is used to manager extensions, to install it run this command.

```
sudo apt install gnome-tweak-tool
```

Now we can search for the application in the Activites View.
